Some old-school mini Guides

In my line of work I often meet "experts" who are not willing or "too busy" to share experience. Or, worse, people who will just disrespect you for proposing something different or try to dissuade you to perform a new task or just push you to... RTFM. Well i did RTFM and I found that it is hardly a step-by-step guide and divagates to topics which are not written for a newbie, neither lead you to complete tasks in a timely manner.
Fortunately there are also people willing to share their experience for the sake of reaching the goal and... start from there the real journey!

Knowledge makes you free!
Enjoy.
